description: "A microservices architecture for automatic music genre classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches"
---

This project implements a comprehensive solution for automatic music genre classification through a microservices architecture. The system combines classical machine learning and deep learning approaches to achieve robust genre classification accuracy on audio inputs.

#### System Architecture

The application is built on a microservices architecture with three main components:

1. **Classification Service**
   - Implements two parallel classification models:
     - SVM classifier using extracted audio features (MFCC, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate)
     - VGG19 deep learning model trained on mel-spectrograms
   - RESTful API endpoints for model inference
   - Audio preprocessing pipeline for feature extraction

2. **Frontend Service**
   - Streamlit-based web interface
   - Real-time audio file upload and processing
   - Interactive visualization of classification results
   - Model performance metrics display

3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Docker containers for each service
   - Jenkins pipeline for automated testing and deployment
   - Load balancing and service discovery
   - Azure cloud infrastructure management

#### Technical Implementation

**Audio Processing Pipeline**
- Audio file validation and format standardization
- Feature extraction using librosa:
  - Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
  - Spectral features (centroid, rolloff, bandwidth)
  - Temporal features (zero-crossing rate, RMS energy)
- Mel-spectrogram generation for deep learning model

**Machine Learning Models**
- Support Vector Machine (SVM):
  - Kernel: RBF with optimized parameters
  - Feature scaling and normalization
  - Cross-validation for model evaluation
  
- VGG19 Neural Network:
  - Transfer learning from ImageNet weights
  - Fine-tuning on GTZAN dataset
  - Data augmentation techniques for robust training
  - Batch normalization and dropout for regularization

**Deployment Infrastructure**
- Containerized services with Docker:
  - Base image optimization for reduced size
  - Multi-stage builds for production deployment
  - Volume mapping for model persistence
  
- CI/CD Pipeline:
  - Automated testing with pytest
  - Code quality checks with SonarQube
  - Automated Docker image building and pushing
  - Blue-green deployment strategy

#### Performance and Metrics

- Model Accuracy:
  - SVM: 78% accuracy on test set
  - VGG19: 85% accuracy on test set
  - Ensemble approach: 87% accuracy

- System Performance:
  - Average response time: <2 seconds
  - Concurrent user support: up to 100
  - API throughput: 50 requests/second

#### Development Workflow

The project followed an agile development methodology:

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Architecture design and component specification
   - Technology stack selection
   - Development roadmap creation

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Iterative development of services
   - Regular integration testing
   - Performance optimization

3. **Deployment Phase**
   - Infrastructure setup on Azure
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Production deployment and monitoring

#### Future Improvements

- Implementation of real-time audio classification
- Addition of more sophisticated ensemble methods
- Integration of user feedback for model improvement
- Expansion of supported audio formats
- Implementation of A/B testing framework
