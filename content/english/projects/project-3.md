Car Rental Mobile App is a cross-platform mobile application providing a seamless experience for car rentals. Developed with the Ionic framework, it offers an intuitive user interface, while the backend built with ExpressJs ensures robust integration with APIs.

Key Features:

- Search and book cars in just a few clicks from your mobile device
- Simplified rental process with a secure online payment system
- Management of reservations, with the possibility of modifying or canceling a rental
- Responsive and attractive user interface designed for optimal user experience on mobile devices
- Solid backend with ExpressJs, ensuring high performance and good query handling

Technologies used:

- Ionic and Angular for the development of the multi-platform mobile application
- ExpressJs and Node.js for building the backend and APIs
- MongoDB for scalable data storage
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and user session management

This project demonstrates my skills in developing modern, high-performance mobile applications, as well as my ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies such as the Ionic and Angular frameworks for the frontend, and ExpressJs for the backend. Using MongoDB and JWT ensures efficient data management and user authentication.
